To build the enviz module you will need to have the java JDK installed.  From this direcotry run ant

    enviz$ ant

You can also deploy the module locally by setting `MODULES_DIR` to point to the modules directory in your labkey deployment (might be something like `C:\labkey\build\deploy\modules`)

    enviz$ ant deploy
